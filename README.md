# Isoform Atlas
## Full-length transcript annotation focusing on immune cells
We generated comprehensively full-length isoform annotation, “isoform atlas”, by sequencing diverse immune cell subsets using a long-read sequencer. A wide-range of information, including TSS, ORF, inserted repetitive elements, and functional domains, was identified for all isoforms expressed in immune cell subsets. In addition, Integrated analysis using isoform atlas and publicly available short-read RNA-seq datasets identified a significant number of isoforms that were switched between IMD and controls. Furthermore, we also examined multiple kinds of QTL effects, including eQTL, sQTL, 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) alternative polyadenylation (APA) quantitative trait loci (3'aQTLs) (Li et al., 2021), and a novel concept of aTSS-QTL, of identified isoforms and revealed disease-relevant isoforms by integrating with GWAS. These results are open on the web (link). Isoform atlas will help bridge the gap between genomic and functional analysis and elucidate the pathogenesis of IMDs.

## Highlights
- Isoform Atlas with a full-length sequence of 29 immune cell types.
- Cell-type specific expression of isoforms are regulated through binding RBPs to long 3’UTR
- Non-uniform insertion of repetitive elements in isoforms
- RNA secondary structure contributes to translational efficiency 
- Immune-mediated diseases GWAS variants harbor various kinds of QTL effects, including eQTL, sQTL, 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) alternative polyadenylation (APA) quantitative trait loci (3'aQTLs) (Li et al., 2021), and a novel concept of alternative transcription start site QTL(aTSS-QTL)

## How can users utilize Isoform Atlas?
- User-friendly web app is available (link: )
- Users can remapping own RNA-seq datasets to Isoform Atlas(./data/isoform_atlas.gtf.gz, GRCh38) and investigate novel pathogenic isoforms
